# Human-Activity-Recognition-on-WISDM-Dataset
In this paper, the time series
dataset, acquired from Wireless Sensor Data Mining Lab
(WISDM) Lab, is used to extract features of common
human activities from a raw signal data of smartphone
accelerometer. A 2D convolutional neural network is used
to visualize the data.
Keywords: Human Activity Recognition, Stratified-K-fold
